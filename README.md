# Quiz App

This project is an **Online Quiz Website** or **Quiz App** built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The app allows users to answer multiple-choice questions, automatically highlighting the correct or incorrect answers based on their selection.

## How the Quiz App Works

- **Multiple Questions**: The quiz consists of multiple questions, each with **four answer choices**.
- **Answer Selection**: When a user selects an answer:
  - If the answer is correct, the button's background color changes to **green**.
  - If the answer is incorrect, the button's background color changes to **red**.
- **No Answer Changes**: Once an answer is selected, it cannot be changed. The user can only proceed to the next question.

## Quiz Score and Result

- After the user submits an answer for the last question and clicks on the **Next** button, the app will display the user's **score** or **result** based on the number of correct answers.

## Features
